sfhackerspace
=============

TL;DR: It's a new hackerspace!  Maybe!  If you help!  Exclamation points!

We're interested in starting another general purpose hackerspace in San Francisco.  It would have a classic board/membership model, be located somewhere reasonable to rent and close to transit, and be dedicated to open community hackery of all types.

Right now we have drafts of the new space bylaws, and the harrassment policy - the hard stuff that isn't fun.  The fun stuff, like coming up with the new name, finding out what the budget is likely to be, and finding/starting in the new space, hasn't been done.  

The next meeting time is still being determined!  Go <a href="http://doodle.com/9esfuzxzvxqssand">and fill out this Doodle</a> if you'd like to join in.
