sfhackerspace
=============

TL;DR: It's a new hackerspace!  Maybe!  If you help!  Exclamation points!

We're interested in starting another general purpose hackerspace in San Francisco.  It would have a classic board/membership model, be located somewhere reasonable to rent and close to transit, and be dedicated to open community hackery of all types.

Right now we have drafts of the new space bylaws, and the harrassment policy - the hard stuff that isn't fun.  The fun stuff, like coming up with the new name, finding out what the budget is likely to be, and finding/starting in the new space, hasn't been done.  That's what this meeting is for, to talk about where we would like to go, and find out if you are interested in helping out and joining us.

My goals for this first meeting are to discover whom among us is keen to help, what they are keen to help with, and between all of us how we can keenly proceed to opening the doors.  We'll probably also come up with a strategy for naming, and a strategy for logo-ing.  The overall direction, culture, etc, will probably come up to a degree, but may be left for a second longer-form conversation in deference to the main purpose of this gathering, let's get started.

Thereby, let's get started.  Click up the Tito <a href="https://tito.io/sfhackerspace/first-posthmeeting">here</a>, and we'll see you 11/12/13 @ 7P at Github!
