webpage considerations

https://www.strikingly.com/

--no upkeep
we don't want to stick someone as the web guy, at the same time,

--wiki

--streaming video of site
let people know if people are doing stuff, can stop by, etc
also helps with 'no sleeping'
--contact info
--meeting notes
--membership details

mostly, we want a full hands off cheep as hell CMS
